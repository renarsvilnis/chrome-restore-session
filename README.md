Chrome Extension that improves Chrome session management. The extension is written because I had an issue, where my computer crashes, after a restart and logging back into I wasn't able to click "Restore Session" button in Chrome and the computer managed to crash again. Next time I restarted Chrome had lost the initially saved session and replaced it with the "New tab" from the last failed start.
